# RangeShifts

## Project Overview

The primary aim of this project is to facilitate the exploration of spatial occurence-data. 

## Features

### Range Class

- Represents a single spatial range dataset.
- Calculate geometric properties like concave hulls and geometric medians.
- Reproject data to different coordinate reference systems.

### RangeCollection Class

- Organize and analyze collections of spatial range datasets.
- Calculate edge values, access properties like centroids and geometric medians, and run Monte Carlo estimates.

### Visualisation (not yet included)

- A proposed scheme for visualising changes in two-dimensional time-series.

## Funding

This research project was supported by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (H.F.R.I.) under the “2nd Call for H.F.R.I. Research Projects to support Faculty Members & Researchers” (Project Number: 3972).
